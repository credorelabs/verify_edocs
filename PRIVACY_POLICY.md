2. Insofar as the Service consists of or is provided to you through a website, please note that:

   2.1. We may use "cookies ", where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when you enter our websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred sites. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.

   2.2. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

3. We may request certain types of data from you in connection with your access or use of the Service.

For the avoidance of doubt, in this Privacy Policy, a reference to a third party service provider or collaborator includes other third parties who provide a service or collaborate with our third party service provider or collaborator.

For the avoidance of doubt, we may also collect, use, disclose and process such information to create reports and produce statistics regarding your transactions with us and your usage of the Services and other services and products provided by Public Sector Entities for record-keeping and reporting or publication purposes (whether internally or externally);

   4.5. for the purposes of storing or creating backups of your data (whether for contingency or business continuity purposes or otherwise), whether within or outside Singapore; and/or

5. We may share necessary data with other Public Sector Entities, and third party service providers in connection with the Service, so as to provide the Service to you in the most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited by law. We will not share your personal data with entities which are not Public Sector Entities, except where such sharing is necessary for such entities to assist us in providing the Service to you or for fulfilling any of the purposes herein.

6. Please note that we may be required to disclose your data by law, including any law governing the use/provision of any service of a third party service provider or collaborator.

7. To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data is secured with appropriate security technologies.

8. You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your data by us with reasonable notice and subject to any prevailing legal or contractual restrictions; however, doing so may prevent the proper functioning of the Service and may also result in the cessation of the Service to you.

9. The Service may contain links to external sites whose data protection and privacy practices may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content and privacy practices of these other websites and encourage you to consult the privacy notices of those sites.

10. Please contact <tradetrust@imda.gov.sg> if you:

    10.1. have any enquires or feedback on our data protection policies and procedures; or

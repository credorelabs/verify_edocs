Developed and pioneered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), TradeTrust was designed to address the challenges of paper-based international trade. 

TradeTrust, which is built upon OpenAttestation , comprises globally accepted standards and frameworks that allow governments and businesses to endorse, exchange and verify documents and effect title transfer across different digital platforms seamlessly.

Dï»¿eveloped by GovTech, OpenAttestation is an open-sourced framework to endorse and verify documents using the blockchain. Documents issued this way are cryptographically trustworthy and can be verified independently.

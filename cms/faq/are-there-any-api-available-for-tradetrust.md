title: Are there any API available for TradeTrust?

The [APIs](https://github.com/TradeTrust/tradetrust-functions) currently available are for verification of documents:

- <https://tradetrust-functions.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/verify>

The creation (deployment) of document store/token registry, issuance of documents, and title transfer will require private keys. Hence, these APIs are not available in TradeTrust.

Business Solution Providers (including SGTraDex) which have integrated TradeTrust to provide digital services dealing with electronic transferable records such as eBLs will typically manage the cryptocurrencies required to pay their clients’ recording of their NFT transactions. 

For such payments, the TradeTrust team has consulted MAS’s regulatory team on the need for licensing requirement. MAS has advised that if the Business Solution Providers are not facilitating buying and selling of digital payment tokens (DPT) and arranging the transmission of DPTs from one account to another, they would not be deemed to be carrying on a business of providing a DPT service under the Payment Services Act 2019. 

MAS further recommends the Business Solution Providers perform their own legal and compliance review before proceeding.

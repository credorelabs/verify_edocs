The use of cryptocurrencies in TradeTrust is to pay for the recording of NFT transactions for electronic transferable records during issuance, ownership transfers, and surrender etc. In operationalising TradeTrust, Business Solution Providers insulate users from cryptocurrencies, managing the cryptocurrencies required to pay for the recording of the NFT transactions.

The cryptocurrency utilised in TradeTrust is neither used in the settlement of the trade (i.e. payment for goods) nor is tradable. The cryptocurrencies involved is used solely to power the recording of the electronic trade financing document from the transferer to transferee on a public blockchain.

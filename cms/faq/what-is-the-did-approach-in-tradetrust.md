The DID is currently only applicable for normal/verifiable documents. By using the DID approach, the issuance of normal/verifiable documents will not incur any gas fee.

However, revocation of the issued docs will require the setup of document store and hence will incur gas fee. Please refer to <https://docs.tradetrust.io/docs/advanced/aws-kms/did-sign-demo> for more details.

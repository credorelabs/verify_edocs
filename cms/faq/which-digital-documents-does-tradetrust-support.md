TradeTrust can support **all** digital documents. 

TradeTrust can be utilised to digitalise two categories of documents used in cross-border trade: 

**Normal documents/Verifiable documents** such as the Certificate of Origin where the provenance and authenticity of the e-document can be easily verified by any party; 

**Transferable Documents** such as Bill of Lading where the e-documentâ€™s title ownership can be transferred from one party to another.

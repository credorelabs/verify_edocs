Trade and supply chain processes are paper heavy with various different forms of documentation being transferred between different companies and government agencies. To digitalise the trade processes, Singapore developed and pioneered TradeTrust, an interoperability framework which comprises a set of globally accepted standards that connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain to ensure that documents issued can be verified in terms of their source and authenticity. TradeTrust also offers trusted interoperability of electronic trade documents (including those of a negotiable nature) across disparate digital platforms.

The TradeTrust framework is aligned with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Lawâ€™s (UNCITRAL) Model Law of Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), which Singapore has adopted into its legislation earlier this year. While MLETR lays out the conditions to be met before a digital record can be deemed as an electronic transferable record (ETR) that is functionally equivalent to its paper counterpart, TradeTrust provides the technical methods designed to satisfy the conditions. More importantly, the technical methods are embodied in a set of software components and tools and are freely available to any platform developer who wish to enable their products to deal with ETRs in an interoperable manner.

In addition, here are properties that are preferred and recommended for easier alignment and integration to the TradeTrust framework.

**1. Actively maintained with a large development community**

In order for key vulnerabilities to be fixed, the blockchain needs to be **actively maintained** by a distributed set of engineers. In addition, formal guidelines for contributions and code review process should be present to protect against malicious code contributions.

**2. Have withstood the test of time**

The blockchain should ideally also be running on a network which has **withstood against the test of time** where other transactions involving large values are being processed and have shown resilience against malicious actors. As the foundation of the application stack as a global state provider, a failure at this layer would be catastrophic.

**3. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatible**

The blockchain should preferably be EVM compatible to allow the users to leverage TradeTrustâ€™s existing smart contract codebase without having to make drastic re-implementations.

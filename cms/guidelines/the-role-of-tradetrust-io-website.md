The website at [https://www.tradetrust.io](https://www.tradetrust.io) serves as:

1. reference implementation on the TradeTrust framework with an intuitive user interface to demonstrate the core capabilities; and
2. a neutral mechanism to self-check for interoperability.

The TradeTrust reference implementation offers the available functions of the TradeTrust framework. It lets users try out how digital trade documents are issued using TradeTrust and how transferable records such as the electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) can be created. This free and neutral interface can also be used to quickly verify the authenticity and provenance of a document issued in such a manner.

For instance, if a user drops a TradeTrust-created eBL onto the website and sees that it has been issued by [www.pilship.com](https://www.pilship.com), he can be assured that it is a legitimate eBL from Pacific International Lines (on the assumption that the entity owns the said domain). In this approach, the user can simplify the trust model to "if issuer domain is an entity I know and trust, I can then be assured that the contents of the document is authentic and legitimate ".

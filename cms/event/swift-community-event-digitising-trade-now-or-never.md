blurb: The Covid-19 pandemic has magnified the need for trade
  digitisation.  With widespread working from home; supply chain; travel, and
  delivery disruptions; and couriers struggling to get through to lockdown
  locations in a timely way, thereâ€™s never been a greater catalyst to go
  digital. Watch this session to find out how SWIFT is taking the global trade
  digitisation effort one step further, in collaboration across the ecosystem.

  During this event, we will introduce BSN's newly launched initiative, the
  Spartan Network, a public infrastructure network based on the lightweight BSN
  Spartan data center software, which is open source, accessible, and can be
  downloaded and installed anonymously. We will focus on enterprise blockchain
  and discuss how it can shape the business market in Singapore.


  The concept of “Public IT Systems” and the BSN Spartan Network, based on non-cryptocurrency public chain technologies, is an important initiative that can serve all types of IT systems to advance transparency, data protection, and easy connectivity for various enterprise and government use cases. Our GFT and Arkadia experts will also talk about Asset Tokenization and multi-asset exchanges.


  We are looking forward to having your participation and sharing of ideas.
